- Accent color: A brighter magenta (#FF3399), slightly lighter than the primary, for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font pairing: 'TeleGroteskNext' (sans-serif) for headlines, mirroring Deutsche Telekom's corporate font, and 'Arial' (sans-serif) for body text, for broad compatibility and readability.
- Simple, clear icons in magenta and gray for desk availability and booking options, maintaining a consistent style.
- Three-section layout: Calendar on the left, interactive desks in the center, and booking management at the bottom. Header includes FLOORPLAN button.
- Smooth transitions with a subtle magenta highlight for desk selection and booking confirmations, providing clear visual feedback.
